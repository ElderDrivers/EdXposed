# Project discontinued

The development of EdXposed was ended on Feb 2nd 2022.
Using EdXposed will result in performance defects. You
should migrate to LSPosed as soon as possible.

## Sorry to our users

After a year of meaningless struggle, a fact has inevitably
laid before us: EdXposed was dead. Our arrogance and
dereliction as developers led to the continuous loss of
users of EdXposed and made them finally choose LSPosed.

We also have to admit: Yes, although I was the so-called
"EdXposed owner", my understanding of Xposed and Android
was far from supporting the continued development of
EdXposed after @solohsu's quit. This developer wasn't the
dark magician mastering all kinds of wizardry in Android,
or an open source leader who are comparable to Richard
Stallman. Instead, he endlessly refused to update and
forced users to roll back Riru and even Magisk.

When we lost john Wu's last trust and self-reflected
bitterly, we realized that it was no longer feasible to
cheat users; since we had failed in our duty as
maintainers, it was no shame to see EdXposed's sunset.

## Migrate to LSPosed

Migrating is easy. Go to Magisk Manager, uninstall EdXposed,
and flash a .zip package of LSPosed. We are sorry that we
have not implemented a backup function in EdXposed, so you
need to reactive each module by yourself.
